        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My childhood felt like something out of a movie. <sup>2</sup>I was a very happy little boy with big dreams. <sup>3</sup>I used to imagine myself as a famous singer, traveling to different countries and performing in front of big crowds. <sup>4</sup>My relatives and older siblings often told me I was full of energy. <sup>5</sup>I was always singing and dancing, bringing joy to those around me. <sup>6</sup>They treated me like their baby and supported my dreams. <sup>7</sup>My ates and kuyas or cousins were my biggest inspiration, they always guided me. <sup>8</sup>I was often included in their performances in Cheerdance competitions because they were fine arts students in UP Diliman. <sup>9</sup>They motivated me to explore my talents. <sup>10</sup>I developed a love for cheerdance at a young age. <sup>11</sup>My childhood was filled with moments of pure joy and learning. <sup>12</sup>I was surrounded by love and support. <sup>13</sup>Playing outside with my friends was my favorite pastime. <sup>14</sup>We would make up games and laugh for hours. <sup>15</sup>My curiosity led me to try new things. <sup>16</sup>I looked up to my older siblings and wanted to be like them. <sup>17</sup>Family gatherings made my childhood even more special. <sup>18</sup>Watching cartoons and imitating characters was something I loved. <sup>19</sup>I always had a thirst for knowledge and adventure. <sup>20</sup>Overall, my childhood was a beautiful and unforgettable time.</p>
