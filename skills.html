            <h3>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student, my technical skills are still developing, but I have a strong foundation in basic programming concepts. I have learned how to write simple programs using languages like Python, C#, and Java, which help me understand how coding works. I can create basic applications that take user input, process data, and display outputs. Additionally, I have experience with HTML and CSS, allowing me to design simple web pages with structured layouts. I understand the importance of logical thinking in programming and have practiced using loops, conditionals, and functions to solve problems. Debugging is another skill I am working on, as I try to identify and fix errors in my code efficiently. I am familiar with using development environments like Visual Studio Code, which makes coding easier. Although I am not yet an expert, I am eager to learn about databases and how they store and manage data. I have explored SQL and can write basic queries to retrieve information from a database. I also have a growing interest in JavaScript, which is essential for making websites interactive. While I am still a beginner, I am learning about object-oriented programming, which helps in creating organized and reusable code. I enjoy experimenting with small projects, such as building simple calculators and to-do list applications. I am also trying to understand the basics of cybersecurity to protect data from threats. Learning about APIs has helped me understand how different applications communicate with each other. I am fascinated by artificial intelligence and hope to explore machine learning in the future. I practice solving coding challenges to improve my problem-solving skills. I also watch online tutorials and read programming documentation to expand my knowledge. Even though I have a long way to go, I am determined to improve my technical skills every day. My curiosity and passion for technology push me to keep learning and exploring new concepts. I believe that by continuing to practice, I will become a skilled programmer in the future.</p>

            <h3>LEADERSHIP SKILLS</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from technical skills, I also have leadership abilities that help me work well with others. I have experience leading small group projects in school, where I help my classmates organize tasks and meet deadlines. I make sure that everyone in the group understands their responsibilities and contributes equally to the project. Communication is one of my strengths, as I always try to listen to different opinions and ensure everyone’s voice is heard. I believe that teamwork is essential in any project, so I encourage my classmates to collaborate and share ideas. Whenever challenges arise, I try to stay calm and find solutions instead of focusing on the problem. I also help motivate my group members when they feel discouraged or stuck on a difficult task. Time management is another skill I practice, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and on schedule. I have also acted as a mediator in group discussions, resolving conflicts and helping everyone stay focused. My leadership skills have improved through class presentations, where I confidently explain topics and answer questions. I enjoy taking initiative, whether it’s organizing study sessions or guiding my peers during assignments. I am also open to feedback and use it to improve my leadership style. Encouraging a positive and productive environment is important to me, as I believe it helps everyone perform their best. I am responsible and reliable, making sure that any task I take on is completed with dedication. I also try to set a good example for my peers by staying disciplined and hardworking. Even though I am still learning how to be a better leader, I am always looking for ways to improve. I read about leadership strategies and observe how effective leaders manage teams. I also believe that respect and understanding are key in leadership, so I treat everyone fairly. These skills will help me in my future career, as leadership is valuable in any field. Developing my leadership abilities will allow me to guide and inspire others in any project or workplace.</p>
